<h2>An anonymous poll app developed with React, Firestore and Tailwind CSS</h2>

<h2>Functionality and purpose of the application</h2>
<p>
Poll Box is an anonymous poll app developed with React, Firestore, and Tailwind CSS. Users can  create polls in a variety of categories and add as many options as they want. They can also vote for other polls and filter the polls by categories.

The app requires no registration but with the help of local storage it still prevents the user to vote for a poll more than once.

UI design was crafted with Tailwind CSS and is fully responsive, so users can access Poll Box on any device. There is also a dark mode option for those who prefer a different look.
